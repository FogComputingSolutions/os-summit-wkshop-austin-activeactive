# SSH to the Alpha OpenStack region server
ssh <alpha region server IP> -l <studentID>

# Take RootSudo role (enter your StudentID password when prompted)
sudo su

# Execute the following command to discover the Utility container IP
lxc-ls --fancy |grep utility

Working example output will look similar to this:

allinone_utility_container-db74af6c              RUNNING  10.0.3.17, 172.29.238.250 ...

Please note the second IP address starting with 172.x.238.x

# SSH to the Utility container
ssh <Utility container IP>

# Source the openrc file with the cloud credentials
source /root/openrc

# Inventory the regions endpoint
openstack endpoint list

Please take note of the endpoint URL suffixes

# Exit out of the Utility container
exit

# Exit out of the OpenStack server
exit
exit

# Repeat the above steps on the Beta OpenStack region server, then proceed to Step 2
